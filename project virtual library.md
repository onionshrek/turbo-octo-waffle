Welcome.
My project consist of a virtual library where anyone can register any book to store it, or counting the quantity of books that where stored in the library.
  
  The library starts with 0 books, and it needs to receive a library, book or (if you already have one), book. So the first visual panel will show this:
       
         select an option:   
         [1] - add library.
         [2] - add book.
         [3] - consult book. 
         option:
